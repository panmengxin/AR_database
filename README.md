# Atmospheric river database
 The Atmospheric river (AR) database over Northern Hemisphere based on PanLu algorithm, for the under review paper entitled "Historical trends of atmospheric rivers in the Northern Hemisphere" by Pan et al. 

 We provide the AR database with 1X1 degree spatial resolution and 6-hourly temporal resolution during 1950–2022. The 0-1 fields for each 6-hourly timestep are provided in the netcdf file, where “1” represents AR present and “0” represents AR absence.
